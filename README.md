# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
## Made by AZOUGA Mourad

This is a the main README for the project: 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Where we dive deep into the world of sorting algorithms.
A quick description to each sorting algorithm is going to be displayed here.
### Bubble sort
In bubble sort we go from through the array (or list) and we check each node i and the node after it
if the node i is smaller than i+1, we go to the next one, if not we switch places of the two nodes
so that the value of i+1 becomes of i and so on.
The best case scenario is that we traverse the list one time : O(n)
The average (and worst) scenario is that we traverse the list several times in order to make it work : O(n^2)

Score: 3-4/10 ; It's easy, and that's that, in big data bases n^2 is too much
